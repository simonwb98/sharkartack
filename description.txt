A Case Study in Synergetics: Simulating shark-feeding dynamics using a modified Swarming model


How it works:
We adopted a simplified 3D swarming model defined by Couzin et. al (\url{doi:10.1006/yjtbi.306}) and modified it to take feeding into account.
The position ($r_i(t)$) and direction ($v_i(t)$) of each shark at every time-step $\tau$ changes according to a set of rules. 
In general:
\begin{align}
  v_i(t + \tau) &= v_i(t) + a_i(t)\tau \\
  r_i(t + \tau) &= r_i(t) + v_i(t)\tau
  \label{eq:eom}
\end{align}
where $a_i(t)$ is a measure for the net interaction of one shark with all the others and the feeding point.

Modeling shark-shark interactions:
For every shark ($r_s$, $v_s$), three zones of interaction are identified (from smallest to largest): 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item zone of repulsion (zor): A number of $N_r$ sharks inside this zone contribute to $a_i$ by a repulsive component
    \begin{equation}
      a_r = -\sum_{j = 0}^{N_r}\frac{r_j - r_s}{|r_j - r_s|^n}.
      \label{eq:zor}
    \end{equation}
    This simulates the size of each shark. The exponent $n$ is a parameter that we let vary.
  \item zone of orientation (zoo): A number of $N_o$ sharks inside this zone contribute to $a_i$ by tending to align neighbouring sharks:
    \begin{equation}
      a_o = \frac{1}{\tau}\sum_{j=0}^{N_o}v_j.
      \label{eq:zoo}
    \end{equation}
    A shark tends to align it's direction according to it's nearest neighbours inside this zone.
  \item zone of attraction (zoa): Outside the zoo, sharks are generally drawn towards each other using an attractive force
    \begin{equation}
      a_a = \sum_{j=0}^{N_a} \frac{r_j - r_s}{|r_j - r_s|^m}.
      \label{eq:zoa}
    \end{equation}
    Sharks that are separated far from each other tend to be attract.
\end{enumerate}
